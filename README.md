##Banking Customer Churn Prediction#
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict customer churn using demographic, transactional, and behavioural data. The objective is to identify customers who are likely to stop using the service, enabling businesses to take proactive retention actions.
Multiple data sources were merged and cleaned to create a unified customer-level dataset. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to understand customer behaviour patterns, churn distribution, and key influencing factors. Feature engineering was applied to improve model performance and interpretability.

A Random Forest Classifier was selected for its ability to handle non-linear relationships and mixed data types while maintaining explainability through feature importance. The model was trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix to account for class imbalance.

The results highlight that customer engagement indicators such as login frequency and recency play a significant role in churn prediction. These insights can be directly used by the business to design targeted retention strategies and improve customer engagement.
